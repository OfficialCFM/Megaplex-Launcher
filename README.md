# Megaplex-Launcher
Launcher for the Megaplex modpack, also if you judge me for playing Minecraft I'll kill your family.  
This is the first version, a newer version is coming soon but in the meantime we'll be using this.

It's licensed under WTFPL. It's a hack and I don't recommend taking any of this code seriously.  
Dependencies: JSON, Zip4j
